## Introduction

I would like to point out some features of my MacBook

I have a MacBook running MacOS Sequoia on an Apple M1 chip

I have been using MacBooks for over a decade, but it took me a long time to learn about some of these features, which is why I wanted to highlight the features that stand out to me

I can introduce each feature in a new section, and explain the feature in the section body

Let's talk about some MacBook features, below

## The menu bar

The menu bar is located at the top of my screen

It runs across the top of my screen, from the top left corner to the top right corner

The Apple menu is located at the top left corner, and it is represented by an Apple icon

When you click on the Apple menu, you see a list of menu items appear below

The first menu item is "About This Mac"

The second menu item is "System Settings"

I sometimes click on "About This Mac" just to get my hardware specs and my operating system version

You can also get this information by going to System Settings -> General -> About

The Apple menu gives me the option to lock my screen, logout, restart, and shut down my computer

It also gives me the option to force quit an application

This can come in handy when an application freezes

I wanted to quickly go over the Apple menu before I move on to the other menus in the menu bar

I'll conclude by saying that the System Settings menu item is very useful

If I need to change a system setting, I can click on the Apple menu, and then click on the System Settings menu item

Now, let's proceed with the other menus

To the right of the Apple menu are the application menus

Right now I am using Terminal, so the application menus belong to the Terminal application

From left to right, they read, "Terminal, Shell, Edit, View, Window, Help"

All of these menus are populated by the Terminal application

The menus on the left are populated by the application that is currently in focus

The one exception is the Apple menu, which is always present in the far left corner

The menus on the right are status menus, and most of them are represented by icons

The menu in the far right corner is the Date & Time menu

If I click on the Date & Time menu, it brings up the Notification Center

To the left of the Date & Time menu is the Siri icon

If I click on the Siri icon, it brings up a prompt that allows me to type to Siri

This is one way of interacting with Siri

I have my iPhone configured so that I can say, "Hey Siri" and ask Siri a question

For example, I can ask my iPhone, "Hey Siri, what is the weather?"

Siri will respond, out loud, by giving me the temperature and describing the weather

I really enjoy the Siri feature on iPhones and Macbooks, so I wanted to spend some time talking about Siri

Now, let's return to the subject of the menu bar

To the left of the Siri icon, on the right hand side of my menu bar, is the Control Center icon

I can bring up the Control Center by clicking on the Control Center icon

From the Control Center, I am able to inspect my Wi-Fi settings and my Bluetooth settings

I am also able to mirror my screen onto my TV

(I have screen mirroring set up and I use it from time to time)

(I happen to have an Apple TV device, which supports screen mirroring)

To the left of the Control Center icon is the Screen Mirroring icon

If the Screen Mirroring icon is missing for you, then you can find it in the Control Center

If it's not missing, then you can click on it directly without going to the Control Center

To the left of the Screen Mirroring icon is the Wi-Fi icon

You can bring up your Wi-Fi settings directly by clicking on the Wi-Fi icon

To the left of the Wi-Fi icon I have a Users icon which lets me switch between users

I have two accounts on my computer, a personal account and a work account

To the left of the Users icon is the Spotlight Search icon

Spotlight is Apple's built-in search tool

I can use Spotlight to search my computer for files and applications

I can also use Spotlight to perform calculations (e.g. if I type sin(π/2) in Spotlight it brings up the result in Calculator)

If I want to open an application (like Terminal) I can think of at least three ways of finding the application and opening it

The first way is to launch the application from my Dock, if it's already present in my Dock

The second way is to search the application in Spotlight Search

I can open Spotlight Search by clicking on the Spotlight Search icon on the right hand side of my top menu bar

I can also open Spotlight Search with the keyboard shortcut command+space

The third way to find and open an application is to use Finder (which is already present in my Dock)

Finder gives us a graphical user interface for navigating our hard drive and finding an application

We can open an application once we find it in Finder

So, those are three ways of finding and opening an application

I use the Dock, Finder, and Spotlight Search to navigate my computer

To the left of the Spotlight Search icon is the Battery icon

It's handy to have this icon, because it tells me when it's time to recharge

To the left of the Battery icon is the Keyboard Input Source icon

If the Keyboard Input Source menu (or just Input menu for short) is missing for you, and you want to add it to your menu bar, you can navigate to System Settings -> Keyboard and then click on Edit under Text Input > Input Sources

This brings up a menu

The first option in the menu is "Show Input menu in menu bar"

I have this option set to true

In the bottom left corner of the menu, you can see there is a plus icon and a minus icon

You can click on the plus icon to add a new keyboard input source, like Unicode Hex Input or Spanish

I use the Unicode Hex Input keyboard very often

When I want to enter π into a document (like this one) I type the sequence option+03c0

This is why I like the Unicode Hex Input keyboard... it allows me to easily enter π into a document

So, returning to the original topic of the menu bar at the top of the screen...

I think we have covered everything

We started out by discussing the Apple menu in the far left corner

Then we talked about the application menus to the right of the Apple menu

The application menus are populated by the application that is currently in focus

Then we talked about the status menus on the right hand side of the menu bar

We talked about each status menu in detail... at least, each status menu that is present in my menu bar

We can add and remove status menus from the menu bar by going to System Settings -> Control Center

From there, we can toggle which status menus appear in the menu bar

For example, I just added Weather to my menu bar

It shows the temperature in my menu bar, and if I click on the icon, it gives me a detailed description of the weather

So it helps to know that we can open Control Center in System Settings to add and remove status menus

This is how you do it in my version of MacOS Sequoia

The process might be different for older operating systems and newer operating systems

As I said, I just added Weather to my status menu

It shows in my menu bar as my leftmost status menu

I really like the Weather menu

When I click on it, it shows me the temperature, the weather conditions, and the forecast

I think it's a keeper

Anyway, I think I am ready to wrap things up

I wanted to give a detailed explanation of the menu bar at the top of the MacBook screen

I hope that this was helpful

I enjoyed writing up this explanation of the menu bar

I think that the next MacBook feature we will talk about is the Desktop

A detailed explanation of the Desktop will be coming up next
